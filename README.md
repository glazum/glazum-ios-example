##Introduction

 [Glazum](http://www.glazum.com/) Framework usage example.

Each question will be shown only once ([it's a Glazum policy](http://www.glazum.com/docs/faq#quesiton-appear-only-once)), so if you'd like to see them again just delete app from device or simulator.

There are 5 questions binded to the next markers:

`:app launched`

* How did you hear about app?
* How likely is it that you will recommend this app to a friend or colleague?
	
`loop changed`

* What do you think about loop feature? (second usage of loop control)
	
`volume changed to maximum`

* Is maximum loudness enough or you?

`volume changed to minimum`

* Do you need mute button or it's ok to change volume for you?


## How see questions

1. Change volume to maximum
2. Change volume to minimum
3. Change loop settings twice
4. Run app twice to see one question bounded to `:app launched`
5. Run app three times to see another question bounded to `:app launched`
